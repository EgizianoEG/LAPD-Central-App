# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Notice or Privacy Policy for the LAPD Central application, with the unique ID `1097879611746029710`, explains how and why we may access, collect, store, use, process, and/or share your information when you use the application. The most recent update or modification date will always be displayed at the footer of this page.

## General Terms

* **"This/the application"**: Refers to the [LAPD Central application](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] and its associated services.
* **"We," "us," "our"**: Refers to the LAPD Central application developer(s).

***

## 1. The Data We Collect and Why

By using the application, we reserve the right to collect basic and necessary Discord information, as listed below. This information is primarily needed to ensure the proper operation of the application and is not used for personalized data collection purposes.

{% hint style="info" %}
For those familiar with code, specifically JavaScript and TypeScript, more details on the data we collect and process can be found in the application's GitHub repository code.
{% endhint %}

### A. Server-Specific Data

When the LAPD Central application is invited to a new Discord server (guild), the following information is automatically collected and stored in our database:

*   **Discord Guild ID** (Server Unique ID):

    The unique identifier (ID) of the Discord server where the application is installed is stored to manage server-specific settings and operations.
* **Server Role, Channel, and Message IDs:**\
  We may store specific IDs, including role and channel IDs, that are either voluntarily provided or automatically captured by the application. These IDs are necessary for the proper functioning of features such as logging channels. Only the message IDs of application-sent messages are stored.
* **Voluntary Server-Specific Logs:**\
  Server members may voluntarily provide logs, which include shift records, leave of absence notices, role-playing duty reports, and other operational logs.

### B. User-Specific Data

* **Discord User ID:**\
  We store the unique identifier (ID) of users who interact with the application's commands, with certain exceptions, to ensure proper functionality and operation of the services.
* **Roblox Account ID** (voluntarily provided, linked accounts)**:**\
  Collected voluntarily to facilitate role-play logging and verify identity. Some commands may require users to link their Roblox account for proper execution. _Note_: Roblox IDs appearing in roleplay logs (e.g., arrest reports) are treated as Game Content. Refer to the [Data Deletion Policy](data-deletion-policy.md#c.-roblox-player-data-fictional-roleplay-records) for details.
* **Operational & Activity Records:**\
  This includes community-essential data such as shift logs, citations, leave of absence notices, and activity reports. These records are retained to maintain guild statistics and history (see [Section 4](privacy-policy.md#id-4-data-retention-period)).

### C. Other Data

Additional data stored by the application may include:

* **Command Usage and Output Errors**\
  This can include the command name, the user ID of the person who executed the command, the guild ID where the command was executed, the date and time, and any provided inputs. This information is stored temporarily for up to 30 days to monitor the application performance, debugging errors, and security auditing.

***

## 2. The Usage of Collected Data

We process your information, including voluntarily provided data, for several purposes, depending on how you interact with the application. This includes (in addition to explanation provided above):

* Delivering and facilitating the delivery of services to the user.
* Responding to user inquiries and providing support.
* Sending administrative information, such as direct message notices.
* Enhancing application performance and ensuring smooth functionality.

***

## 3. Collected Data Sharing

We respect your privacy and do not share your data with any third parties, except in the following cases:

*   **Discord (the company)**

    Data may be shared with Discord for service integration and application functionality.
*   **Legal Compliance**

    We may share data if required by law or in response to lawful requests from authorities.

_Other than these scenarios, we do not share your data with third-party entities unless explicitly required by legal obligations._

***

## 4. Data Retention Period <a href="#id-4-data-retention-period" id="id-4-data-retention-period"></a>

We retain Personal Profile Data only for as long as necessary to facilitate your use of the application and to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. No purpose in this notice requires us to keep your data indefinitely.

* **Personal Data:** Deleted automatically after a grace period when you leave a guild.
* **Operational Data:** Retained for guild history and operational continuity; it can be anonymized upon request.

For specific timelines (including the grace period) and instructions on how to request deletion or use the `/preferences` command for self-deletion, please read our full [Data Deletion Policy](data-deletion-policy.md).
